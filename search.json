How does articles link to each other?\nThis website contains information on an analysis done on a network created with a dataset of articles from 2008/2009. We explored their popularity based on the node degree and computed their assortativity w.r.t. article sentiment.\nTo achieve this, we utilized network analysis to create a graph representation of article connections via their links. We performed NLP techniques to extract keywords and sentiment from article titles and key phrases.\nFurthermore, we explored the largest communities in our network and took a deep dive on articles related to the 2008 US presidential elections."

    "text": "Communities.png\n\n\n\nWhy filter the dataset to the 100 largest weakly connected components?\nEven after the prepossessing which filtered out many of the nodes without text, we still had a network with millions of nodes. However, many of these nodes were isolated articles that were only connected to one or two other nodes which were otherwise isolated from the rest of the nodes. We expect these to be small articles about very specific topics, and we decided to focus on the nodes that where in more connected parts of the network, since we believed they would represent larger news stories about the more popular topics. We extract this subgraph because we want to use NLP to analyse the large clusters.\n\n\nCommunity plot\nAfter performing that filtering, we still had a network with around 11.000 nodes and edges. We performed community detection within these connected subcomponents, and the result can be seen in the network, where each node is coloured by their community. It can be seen that there are tendencies for some nodes to be exclusively connected to the same one high degree node which we hypothesise can be a breaking news story which many other articles will reference two. We do not report the modularity since it does not make sense to analyse when we have filtered out all the isolated nodes."

Neutral arrticles are represented by grey nodes. We computed the log normalised sentiment for each article by summing the nltk sentiment score of each word in the key phrases and dividing by the log length of the key phrases, giving us a measure of the overall sentiment of an article. Intuitively by visualizing the plot, we can hypothesize that articles with similar sentiment tend to link to each other.\n\nAssortativity coefficient with respect to sentiment\n\nSentiment Assortativity coefficient = 0.143\nTo test our hypothesis, we then calculate the assortativity coefficient of the entire graph w.r.t. the sentiment scores. This coefficient confirms our hypothesis that positive articles are more likely to link to other positive articles whilst negative articles are more likely to link to other negative articles, then they would be expected to by random. The same goes for neutral articles. This implies that people may caught up in loops of negative or positive articles.\n\n\n\nSentiment distribution histogram\nAs the histogram shows we have many articles with an average neutral sentiment (sentiment = 0) and less so that are overall positively or negatively charged. Most are within the range of [-1,1] with a few outliers.\n\n\n\nSentimentsScoresNormalisedHistogram.png"

    "text": "US Presidential Elections\n\nHow did the rhetorics of news articles around Obama and McCain differ?\nGoing further than the sentiment of the articles, we also analyzed the words used in articles related to Obama and his republican counterpart John McCain. The words most often used in their context are visualized in two word clouds. Blue for the Obama and red for McCain. A striking difference between the two, is how often Obama was used in articles with McCain, whereas the name McCain did not appear nearly as often in articles with Obama. This may likely be due to our analysis period. We analyze articles from 2008 to 2009. While both names are likely to be used in the same article before the election, the focus shifts to the winner. By the end of 2008, after Obama was elected, McCain did not get nearly as much media attention anymore.\n\n\n\nObama\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCain\n\n\n\n\nKeyword filtering example: “Obama”\nAn interesting potential user feature of our tool is that one can filter the network for one or more keywords and only look at the network of articles that contain one or more of these and analyse that. We made an example with Obama, who was elected president on November 4th 2008, during the period in which our data is recorded. The visuals show how the network grows for each month, where the nodes are coloured by sentiment.\n\n\nObama timeline sentiment\nThe line graph shows how the monthly averages sentiment scores of all the articles, the overall positive articles and the overall negative articles change during the period from August 2008 to March 2009. Obama widely known to have had a good closing month during October before the election on November 4th, which can also be seen on the graph. It is interesting to see how the negative articles are at their most negative just before the election in October and then again in February, just as the bear market was going down to its lowest level indicated by the Dow Jones index. It is also interesting that the positivity of the positive articles seems to go up during the same periods as if to counterattack the negativity.\n\nObama Gif\n\n\n\nObama Network\n\n\n\n\n\nObama Sentiment"
